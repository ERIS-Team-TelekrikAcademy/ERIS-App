# ERIS-App
A Telerik Academy team proejct

Description: 
It's a social network for "special" services. The webpage will offer two types of users: Hitman and Client.

Hitmen offer theyr services to clients via Contract (Client chooses a hitman and sends a contract offer).

Once the hitman approves the contract the additional information is discussed in chat.

There is a wpf application that will serve for chatting (and maybe we'll integrate the chat in the website as well).

When the contract is successfull(or not) the client will be given the ability to rate the hitman.

Also the hitman profile will offer a greater functionallity then the Client -> will have gallery of picures and whatever more we can think of.
