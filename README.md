# ERIS-App
Teamwork project for the course "Web services & cloud" 2015 @ TelerikAcademy.

## Description 
The idea behind our application is to serve as a social network for "special" services. The network has two types of user: a hitman or a client.

- Hitmen offer their services to clients via *contracts*.
- Client chooses a hitman and sends a contract offer.
- Once the hitman approves the contract the additional information is discussed in chat.
- When the contract is successful (or not), the client will be given the opportunity to rate the respective hitman.
